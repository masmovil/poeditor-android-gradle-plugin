Usage
--------
Just run the new ```importPoEditorStrings``` task via Android Studio or command line:

```
./gradlew importPoEditorStrings
```

This task will:
- download all strings files (every available lang) from PoEditor given the api token and project id.
- process the incoming strings to fix some PoEditor incompatibilities with Android strings system. 
- create and save strings.xml files to ```/values-<lang>``` (or ```/values``` in case of the default lang). It supports
region specific languages by creating the proper folders (i.e. ```/values-es-rMX```).

Handle Tablet specific strings
--------
You can mark some strings as tablet specific strings by adding ```_tablet```suffix to the string key in PoEditor. The plugin will extract tablet strings to its own XML and save it in ```values-<lang>-sw600dp```.

Therefore you could define:

Poeditor Strings 

```welcome_message: Hey friend``` and ```welcome_message_tablet: Hey friend how are you doing today, you look great!```

The plugin will create two strings.xml:

/values/strings.xml
```xml
<string name="welcome_message">Hey friend</string>
```

/values-sw600dp/strings.xml
```xml
<string name="welcome_message">Hey friend how are you doing today, you look great!</string>
```

Handle placeholders
--------
You can add placeholders to your strings. We've defined a placeholder markup to use in PoEditor string definition; it uses  {{value}}: 

PoEditor string:

```welcome_message: Hey {{user_name}} how are you``` 

will become, in strings.xml

```xml
<string name="welcome_message">Hey %1%s how are you</string>
```

If you need more than one placeholder in the same string, you can use ordinals:

PoEditor string:

```welcome_message: Hey {1{user_name}} how are you, today offer is {2{current_offer}}``` 

will become, in strings.xml

```xml
<string name="welcome_message">Hey %1%s how are you, today offer is %2%s</string>
```

This way you could change the order of the placeholders depending on the language:

PoEditor string with spanish translation:

```welcome_message: La oferta del día es {2{current_offer}} para ti, {1{user_name}}``` 

will become, in values-es/strings.xml

```xml
<string name="welcome_message">La oferta del día es %2%s para ti, %1%s</string>
```

To-Do
-------
* Change placeholder system to avoid using ordinals by taking into account the placeholder value instead.
